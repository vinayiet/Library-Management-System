# Library Management System (LMS)

## Overview
This project is a Library Management System (LMS) developed using Flask and related technologies. It provides functionalities for managing books, user accounts, and interactions within the library system.

## Flow of the System
1. **User Access:**
   - Users access the system through a web interface.
   - They can log in or register if they are new users.

2. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Authentication: Users provide their credentials (username/password) to log in.
   - Authorization: Different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) determine access to specific features.

3. **Home Page:**
   - Displays general information about the library.
   - Provides navigation to different sections like book listing, user profile, etc.

4. **Book Management:**
   - Users can view a list of books available in the library.
   - Authorized users (e.g., librarians) can add, edit, or delete books.
   - Each book entry includes details like title, author, quantity, etc.

5. **User Account Management:**
   - Users can view their account details, borrowing history, fines, etc.
   - Admins can manage user accounts, create new accounts, and modify user information.

6. **Search and Filter:**
   - Users can search for books based on title, author, genre, etc.
   - Advanced search and filtering options enhance user experience.

7. **Interaction and Feedback:**
   - Intuitive interfaces (forms, clickable lists) enable user interactions.
   - Feedback mechanisms (flash messages, notifications) provide feedback on actions.

8. **Security Measures:**
   - Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms protect user data.
   - Security measures like CSRF protection, password hashing ensure system security.

9. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - System logs track user activities, errors, and important events.
   - Monitoring tools may be used to ensure system stability and performance.

## Getting Started
